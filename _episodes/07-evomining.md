  <img src="../fig/evomining.gif" alt="a) EvoMining expansion-and-recruitment pipeline. A group of grey stacked cylinders representing genomes in a database (DB).
                                   	Homologues and expansions of seed enzymes, represented as an orange arrow, from the enzyme DB
                                   	are searched by blastp in the genome DB.
                                   	The outcome is integrated as the expanded enzyme families (EFs) within the genome DB.
                                   	Bidirectional best hits (BBH) of seed enzymes, red arrows, are marked as conserved metabolism.
                                   	The EFs are amplified after being compared against a DB of natural products (NP) biosynthetic enzymes,
                                   	represented by a blue cylinder, to find recruitments defined as enzymes of the family that are part of a MIBiG BGC.
                                   	b) The genome DB, represented by the gray stacked cylinders, is searched as previously described.

 Usually, bioinformatics tools related to the prediction of Natural Products (NP)
 biosynthetic genes try to find metabolic pathways of enzymes that are known to be
 related with the synthesis of secondary metabolites. However, these approaches
 fail for the discovery of novel biosynthetic systems. Thus,
 [EvoMining](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000260) tries to circumvent this problem by detecting novel enzymes that may be implicated in the synthesis of new natural products in Bacteria.
 
 To know more about EvoMining you can read [Selem et al, Microbial Genomics 2019](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000260).   
 
EvoMining searches protein expansions that may have evolved from the conserved
metabolism into a specialized metabolism. It builds phylogenetic
trees based on all the protein copies of a certain enzyme in a given genome
database. The output tree differentiates copies that are related with the
conserved metabolism, copies that are known to be implicated in discovered
NP-producing-BGCs i.e. BGCs from [MiBIG database](https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/)
and, optionally, protein copies that belong to BGCs predicted by
[antiSMASH](https://antismash-db.secondarymetabolites.org/). Finally,
some branch in the tree will be depicted as "EvoMining hits", which represent
enzyme expansions that are evolutionary closer to those copies related with
the secondary metabolism (MiBIG or antiSMASH BGCs) than to those related with
the conserved (primary) metabolism.

## Run evomining image

First, place yourself at your working directory.
~~~
$ cd   ~/pan_workshop/results/genome-mining/corason-conda/EXAMPLE2  
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
CORASON_GENOMES  Corason_Rast.IDs  cpsg.query  GENOMES  output
~~~
{: .output}  

The general structure of a docker container is shown in the next bash-box. Note that
it requires to specify which docker container will run. Optionally,
with `-v` flag it is possible to share a directory with the container,
with `-p` flag a port is shared and it is also possible to specify which
program will run inside the container.  
~~~
$ docker run --rm -i -t -v <your local directory>:<inside docker directory> -p <inside port>:80 <docker container> <program inside docker>    
~~~
{: .language-bash}   

EvoMining is inside a docker container, so the general structure
to start your analysis will be as follows:   
~~~
$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/EvoMining/exchange -p 8080:80 nselem/evomining:latest /bin/bash   
~~~
{: .language-bash}   

Let's explain the pieces of this line.   
 
| command  |                             	Explanation                                        	|    
|:-------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|    
|docker   | tells the system that we are running a docker command                               	|    
| run 	|  the command that we are running is to run a docker container                      	|    
| --rm	|  this container will be removed after closed                                       	|    
| -i  	|  this container allows user interaction                                            	|    
| -t  	|  this interaction will be through a terminal                                       	|   
| -v  	| a data volume (directory) will be shared between your local machine and the container  |    
| -p  	|  a port will allow a web based app                                                 	|   	 

However, sometimes the port 80 is busy, in that case you can
use other ports like 8080 or 8084. If this is the case, please use the port `80X`
where X is a number between 01..30 provided by your instructor.   
```
$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/EvoMining/exchange -p 8080:80 nselem/evomining:latest /bin/bash  
$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/EvoMining/exchange -p 8084:80 nselem/evomining:latest /bin/bash  
```

If your docker container worked, now you will see in your terminal
a new prompt. Instead of the usual dollar sign, there should be a number
`#` at the beginning of your terminal. This is because now you are inside
the docker container and you have `sudo` permissions inside the docker.  
~~~
#  
~~~
{: .language-bash}

To exit container use `exit`  
~~~
# exit
~~~
{: .language-bash}  
 
And now your prompt must be back in the dollar sign  
~~~
$   
~~~
{: .language-bash}  

## Set EvoMining genomic database
Start the container again with your corresponding port.  
~~~
$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/EvoMining/exchange -p 80X:80 nselem/evomining:latest /bin/bash   
~~~
{: .language-bash}   

Though we will NOT run the test EvoMining command, it looks as follows:
~~~
# perl startEvoMining.pl  
~~~
{: .code}
 
Instead of that, customize the genomic database by using the same as CORASON.  
Notice that EvoMining requires RAST-like annotated genomes and for this reason
we are using the fasta files that CORASON converts from our gbk inputs.
~~~
# perl startEvoMining.pl -g GENOMES -r  Corason_Rast.IDs
~~~
{: .code}

  <img src="../fig/tree.png" alt="EvoMining phylogenetic reconstruction providing evolutionary insights into the metabolic origin
                              	and the fate of members of diverse EF from the Streptococcus example.
                              	Seed enzymes are labeled in orange. The most conserved copies or central metabolism copies are marked in red.
                              	Enzyme copies recruited into specialized metabolism, contained in MIBiG, are labeled in blue.
                              	Enzyme copies that are closer to blue enzyme recruitments than to red conserved enzymes are labeled in green
                              	and represent EvoMining Hits. Extra copies with an unknown metabolic fate are shown in gray." />
</a>

Finally, remember that `X` means your user-number and open your browser
at the address: `http://132.248.196.38:80X/EvoMining/html/index.html`. Once there,
just click the start button and enjoy! (click on the submit buttons!) 

When you finish using this container, please exit it.

#exit

## Visualize your results in MicroReact  

Firstly, you have to run all the pipeline in the website:
http://<yourip>/EvoMining/html/index.html, and then all the
output files will be generated. You can use the EvoMining
basic interface or take your results into MicroReact.  

EvoMining outputs are stored in the directory `<conserved-db>_<natural-db>_<genomes-db>`  
~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}
  
  To explore EvoMining outputs, you need to upload 1.nwk and 1.csv
files to [microReact](https://microreact.org/). 
There are many methods to download files from the server to your local computer.

If you are using JupyterHub you explore the file folders and select the files and then press the download button.


You can use the export button in the file panel of R studio. 
  To download the files, first in the files panel open in 
  the directory `~/pan_workshop/results/genome-mining/corason-conda/EXAMPLE2/ALL_curado.fasta_MiBIG_DB.faa_GENOMES/blast/seqf/tree`,  
  <a href="../fig/ExportFiles1.jpg">
  <img src="../fig/ExportFiles1.jpg" alt="Select the path to download file" />
</a>
  
  Then, select files 1.nwk and 1.csv in that directory, click `more` 
  in the engine icon, and select the `export` option in the menu. The files
  will be downloaded to your local computer, and now you will be able to
  upload them to MicroReact.  
  
  <a href="../fig/ExportFiles2.png">
  <img src="../fig/ExportFiles2.png" alt="Select the path to download file" />
</a>  
  
Alternatively, If your prefer to use the terminal to download files
the `scp` protocol can download the files into your local machine. 
```
scp betterlab@132.248.196.38:~/pan_workshop/results/genome-mining/corason-conda/EXAMPLE2/ALL_curado.fasta_MiBIG_DB.faa_GENOMES/blast/seqf/tree/1.nwk ~/Downloads/.
scp betterlab@132.248.196.38:~/pan_workshop/results/genome-mining/corason-conda/EXAMPLE2/ALL_curado.fasta_MiBIG_DB.faa_GENOMES/blast/seqf/tree/1.csv ~/Downloads  
```
 
Here you can find the [MicroReact visualization](https://microreact.org/project/e8b7wWZkovtavPFFpBXRPp-evomining-streptococcus-example)
of this EvoMining run.  

<a href="../fig/EvoMiningMicroReact.png">

                                             	expansion enzymes in gray, recruited enzymes contained in MIBiG in blue,
                                             	secondary metabolism enzymes (EvoMining hits) are marked in green,
                                             	and seed enzymes are colored in orange. Below appears the metadata from the run,
                                             	organized in a five row table including Id, metabolism, genome, function and copies." />

## Other resources    
To run EvoMining with a larger conserved-metabolite DB you can use
[EvoMining Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1219709#.YqEsFqjMLrc) data.

To explore more EvoMining options, please explore [EvoMining wiki](https://github.com/nselem/evomining/wiki).

## Set the conserved-enzymes database

When using EvoMining, oftenly you will desire to construct your own conserved enzymes database.
To know more about how to configure a database, consult the EvoMining wiki
in the [EvoMining databases](https://github.com/nselem/evomining/wiki/Databases-Conformation) part.
Natural products database could also be replaced for another set of
genes that are "true positives", for example a set of regulatory genes.

As an example, transform the file `cpsg.query` into the format of this database.
This file contains the aminoacid sequence of the _cpsG_ gene. Firstly, copy this file
into what will become the conserved-enzymes database.  
~~~
$ cp cpsg.query cpsg_cdb
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now, it requires some editing. Open nano editor and change the first line `>cpsg` to
`>SYSTEM1|1|phosphomannomutase|Saga `. EvoMining conserved-database needs a
four-field format pipe-separated that contains; the name of the metabolic system to which the
enzyme belongs (SYSTEM1), a consecutive number of the enzyme (1 in this case),
the function of the enzyme, and finally, an abbreviation of the organism Saga, (_S. Agalactiae_).  
The reason behind this is that this was the way we needed EvoMining for its first use and we have not changed the headers since.  
~~~
$ nano cpsg_cdb
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Run your EvoMining docker
~~~
$ docker run --rm -i -t -v $(pwd):/var/www/html/EvoMining/exchange -p 80X:80 nselem/evomining:latest /bin/bash   
~~~
{: .language-bash}   

and inside this new container:
~~~
# perl startEvoMining.pl -g GENOMES -r  Corason_Rast.IDs -c cpsg_cdb
~~~
{: .code}

Use the website again and think about the results.
